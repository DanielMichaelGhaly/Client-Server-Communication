# Client-Server-Communication
This project implements a real-time client-server communication system to monitor and display system performance metrics from 2 separate clients. Client collects CPU , GPU usage, and memory utilization sending them to a centralized server over a socket connection. Server processes data from clients, dynamically updating a website for visualization.
